Materials for the Mechatronics 101 workshop at the 2025 WISE National Conference. See the [workshop slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17NoBU563knMwBu_dEoikSRJojj2nbHyHuLxpcGSuef4/edit?usp=sharing) for activity details.

## Microcontroller setup activity

The setup activity in this workshop generally follows [this guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/) from the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

1. Download the **Thonny Python IDE** from [the Thonny website](https://thonny.org).
2. Plug your **Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller** into a USB-A port in your computer using the provided micro-USB to USB-A cable.
3. Open Thonny. Verify that the **Shell** panel at the bottom of the editor indicates that you are using a Raspberry Pi Pico with the MicroPython interpreter.
